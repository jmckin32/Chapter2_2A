A program that checks an email (string) for any suspicious words or phrases that make it seem like a scam

Variables: the email the user inputs, the "scam score", the chances of the email being a scam

Functions: main, an extra one for calculating likelihood of being a scam

1: Initialize variables
2: Read the text document of sus words/phrases into a list
3: Ask user to input email
4: Check, for every word in the list, if it appears in the email, if so, add a point to the scam score and add the word to the "sus words used" list. Repeat until the entire list has been gone through once.
5: Calculate the likelihood of being a scam based on an arbitrary number I made up (I thought 4 uses of a sus phrase would be enough for 100% but I made it easy to change)
6: Print the results
